# GameDump

This project is phase one in creating a centralized game list with which my friends and myself can keep track of our games we've played cross-platform with ratings and brief descriptions.

If anybody knows how to get an API out of Sony, feel free to clue me in or there is gonna be some ugly hacking scrapin that will happen!
